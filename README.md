Web application to help people prepare for coding interviews

When I was looking for an internship, I faced some issues when training for my interview: I had to face my employer during a coding interview. In order to prepare for this interview, I had to look online for some advices and coding exercises and one the main issue I faced was the fact that there are a lot of websites or videos offering those services but not one platform “to rule them all” offering everything to facilitate the training process.
